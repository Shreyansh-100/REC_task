# MDETR - Referring Expression Comprehension Model

This repository contains the necessary scripts and datasets to use the pre-trained MDETR model fine-tuned on RefCOCO dataset for performing Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) inference and evaluation.

## Overview
1. The pre-trained model has been obtained from the official MDETR GitHub repository and fine-tuned on the complete RefCOCO dataset to suit our task.

2. For a comprehensive overview, refer to: [MDETR: Modulated Detection for End-to-End Multi-Modal Understanding](https://github.com/ashkamath/mdetr).

3. Steps for evaluating the REC model are available at [mdetr-REC](https://github.com/ashkamath/mdetr/blob/main/.github/refexp.md).

## Our Aim
1. To identify and utilize the appropriate dataset and pre-trained model.

2. We will use the MDETR model fine-tuned on the RefCOCO dataset for the Referring Expression Comprehension task.
